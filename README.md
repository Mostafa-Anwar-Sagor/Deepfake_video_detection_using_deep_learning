## 🎯 Overview

This project aims to detect video deepfakes using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques combining **ResNext CNN** and **LSTM** networks. The system achieves deepfake detection through transfer learning, where a pretrained ResNext CNN extracts feature vectors from video frames, which are then processed by an LSTM layer for temporal analysis and classification.

### 🔑 Key Highlights

- **93.58% Accuracy** on 100-frame analysis
- **Real-time Detection** with adjustable frame sequences
- **Web-based Interface** built with Django
- **Face Detection & Tracking** using advanced computer vision
- **Dockerized Application** for easy deployment

---

- Upload and analyze videos in MP4, AVI, and MOV formats
- Adjustable frame sequence length (10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 frames)
- Real-time face detection and tracking
- Visual frame-by-frame analysis

### 🧠 AI/ML Capabilities
- **ResNext-50** CNN for spatial feature extraction
- **LSTM** for temporal sequence analysis
- Transfer learning from ImageNet
- Multiple pre-trained models for different accuracy-speed tradeoffs

### 🎨 Modern Web Interface

## 📊 Model Performance

Our models have been trained and tested on diverse datasets with impressive results:

| Model Name | Videos | Frames | Accuracy |
|------------|--------|--------|----------|
| model_84_acc_10_frames_final_data.pt | 6000 | 10 | **84.21%** |
| model_87_acc_20_frames_final_data.pt | 6000 | 20 | **87.79%** |
| model_89_acc_40_frames_final_data.pt | 6000 | 40 | **89.35%** |
| model_90_acc_60_frames_final_data.pt | 6000 | 60 | **90.59%** |
| model_91_acc_80_frames_final_data.pt | 6000 | 80 | **91.50%** |
| model_93_acc_100_frames_final_data.pt | 6000| 100| **93.59%** |

> 💡 **Note:** Higher frame counts provide better accuracy but require more processing time. Choose based on your speed-accuracy requirements.

   cd Deepfake_detection_using_deep_learning
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Linux/Mac
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd "Django Application"
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download pre-trained models**
   - Download models from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UX8jXUXyEjhLLZ38tcgOwGsZ6XFSLDJ-?usp=sharing)
   - Place them in `Django Application/models/` directory

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

### Option 2: Docker Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull and run the application
docker run --rm --gpus all -v static_volume:/home/app/staticfiles/ \
  -v media_volume:/app/uploaded_videos/ \
  --name=deepfakeapplication YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE

# Run Nginx proxy
docker run -p 80:80 --volumes-from deepfakeapplication \
  -v static_volume:/home/app/staticfiles/ \
  -v media_volume:/app/uploaded_videos/ YOUR_NGINX_IMAGE
```

Access at: `http://localhost:80`

## 💻 Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Upload Video**
   - Click the upload area or drag & drop your video file
   - Supported formats: MP4, AVI, MOV

2. **Select Frame Sequence**
   - Use the slider to choose number of frames (10-100)
   - More frames = Higher accuracy but slower processing

3. **Analyze**
   - Click "Analyze Video" button
   - Wait for processing (typically 10-30 seconds)

4. **View Results**
   - See prediction: REAL or FAKE
   - Check confidence score
   - Review analyzed frames
   - View detected faces

### Command Line (Model Training)

```bash
cd "Model Creation"
jupyter notebook
# Open Model_and_train_csv.ipynb
# Follow the steps in the notebook
```
