## 🎯 Overview

This project aims to detect video deepfakes using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques combining **ResNext CNN** and **LSTM** networks. The system achieves deepfake detection through transfer learning, where a pretrained ResNext CNN extracts feature vectors from video frames, which are then processed by an LSTM layer for temporal analysis and classification.

### 🔑 Key Highlights

- **93.58% Accuracy** on 100-frame analysis
- **Real-time Detection** with adjustable frame sequences
- **Web-based Interface** built with Django
- **Face Detection & Tracking** using advanced computer vision
- **Dockerized Application** for easy deployment

## 💻 Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Upload Video**
   - Click the upload area or drag & drop your video file
   - Supported formats: MP4, AVI, MOV

2. **Select Frame Sequence**
   - Use the slider to choose number of frames (10-100)
   - More frames = Higher accuracy but slower processing

3. **Analyze**
   - Click "Analyze Video" button
   - Wait for processing (typically 10-30 seconds)

4. **View Results**
   - See prediction: REAL or FAKE
   - Check confidence score
   - Review analyzed frames
   - View detected faces

### Command Line (Model Training)

```bash
cd "Model Creation"
jupyter notebook
